<h2>Grand Hyatt는 어떤 호텔인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hyatt.com/brands/grand-hyatt" target="_blank" title="Grand hyatt official url">Hyatt Hotels Corporation</a>, commonly known as Hyatt Hotels & Resorts, is an American multinational hospitality company headquartered in the Riverside Plaza area of Chicago that manages and franchises luxury and business hotels, resorts, and vacation properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">The Hyatt Corporation came into being upon purchase of the Hyatt House, at Los Angeles International Airport, on September 27, 1957. In 1969, Hyatt began expanding internationally. Hyatt has grown by developing new properties and through acquisitions, with the biggest growth coming from the acquisition of AmeriSuites (later rebranded Hyatt Place) in 2004, Summerfield Suites (later rebranded Hyatt House) in 2005, and Two Roads Hotels in 2018.[6][7][8] As of September 30, 2019, Hyatt has over 100,000 employees worldwide servicing nearly 900 properties across 20 brands in 60 countries.[9]</p>
